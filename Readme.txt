# Beans – Multi-Surface Ray Tracing for Grasshopper

---

## Overview

This plugin **"Beans*"** enables intuitive ray tracing in Grasshopper. Simply placing surfaces is all it takes — no complex spaghetti-like chart networks required. It is designed to make ray tracing visually straightforward, with multi-surface refraction consolidated into a single component.

"Beans" is designed for freeform lens surface design, intended to be used with a minimal number of surfaces in combination with Grasshopper's optimization tools such as Galapagos. To minimize computational load and maintain design clarity, the number of input surfaces is limited to 5. (For my research in the field of ophthalmology, five screens were sufficient.)

*The plugin name "Beans" is a nod to etymology: the word *lens* derives from the Latin for *lentil* — a legume. A playful homage to this linguistic journey from bean to optics, in the tradition of Grasshopper's plugin naming culture.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release of **Beans.gha**.
2. Make sure the file is unlocked: right click → Properties → Unblock (if visible).
3. Copy and paste it into the Grasshopper Libraries folder, usually:

```
C:\Users\<YourUser>\AppData\Roaming\Grasshopper\Libraries
```

4. Restart Rhinoceros and Grasshopper.
5. Access the component from the **Beans tab → Ray Trace**.

## Acknowledgements

This plugin was developed based on CAD operation guidance by **Keita Murata**, further evolved by the author through inspiration from the Mosquito plugin (Carson Smuts, Food4Rhino), as part of the coursework in:

* **Digital Design Practice (FY2022, Creative Technology Course, Industrial Design)**
* **Machine Learning (FY2022, Creative Technology Course, Digital Technology, Prof. Hisashi Hayashi)**

at the **Advanced Institute of Industrial Technology (AIIT), Tokyo**.

This work is also conducted in association with the **Research Center for Health Design, AIIT** (Associate Professor Ken-ichi Tabei, Ph.D.).

Special thanks to **Carson Smuts (Mosquito, Food4Rhino)** for the creative inspiration.

Development was significantly accelerated with the assistance of LLM technology (**Claude by Anthropic**). What was once beyond reach in 2022 became achievable in 2026 — a testament to how rapidly AI tools have evolved.
